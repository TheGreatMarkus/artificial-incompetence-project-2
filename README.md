# Artificial Incompetence: Project 2 Submission
Github Repository of the Artificial Incompetence team for COMP472: Project 2  
Github URL: https://github.com/TheGreatMarkus/artificial-incompetence-project-2.git

### Instructions

To run our submission for project 2, do the following:

1. Make sure python3 is installed on your computer:
    * `python3 -V`
2. Make sure the following dependencies are installed, either through pip or other dependency managers: `numpy, pandas, matplotlib, nltk (BYOM) and sklearn (BYOM)`
3. Run the main file: 
    * `python3 main.py`
4. The program will then ask for you to pick an option:
    * Option 1: Run the required model (not BYOM). 
    * Option 2: Run the required model against a grid of hyper-parameters. This option is for our benefit and not part of the submission, so that we can easily run models with various hyper-parameter values to find the best combination.
    * Option 3: Run the LidStone BYOM, our first BYOM
    * Option 4: Run the LidStone BYOM, our second BYOM
    * Note: options 1, 3 and 4 will require additional input for the values of the hyper-parameters
5. The relevant output files will then be generated. Evaluation and trace files are outputted to the `evaluation` and `trace_files` folder respectively.
